Subject: Q2 Update – AI Platform Integration Over Budget
3rd February 2025
Body: All,

Quick heads-up that the AI Platform Integration with our CRM system has exceeded its initial budget by 27%. The main driver was higher-than-expected consulting costs and the need to upgrade our API gateway for compatibility.

Initial budget: $2.2M
Revised forecast: $2.8M

We’re exploring cost mitigation options, including phasing out lower-priority features and reducing reliance on external vendors for Phase 2. Detailed breakdown will be shared in the Finance Ops call on Wednesday.

Regards,
Daniel Mercer
