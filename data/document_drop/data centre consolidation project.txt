Subject: Timeline Shift – Data Center Consolidation Project
4th March 2025
Body: Team,

Due to delays in securing hardware for the new Sydney data center, the consolidation timeline has been pushed back by 6 weeks. This affects our ability to decommission two legacy sites in Brisbane, which were projected to save $500K per month in operational costs starting in May.

We’re assessing interim measures, but it’s likely we’ll incur additional running costs of ~$750K over the delay period. I’ve flagged this to Finance for the Q3 forecast update.

Let’s regroup on mitigation options tomorrow.

Thanks,
Anjali Patel
Director, Infrastructure Programs
