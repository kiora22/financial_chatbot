Subject: Action Required – Rising Costs on SaaS Licenses
12th December 2024
Body: Hi everyone,

Just got notice from WorkStream360 – our primary project management SaaS – that their enterprise tier pricing is increasing by 20% starting July 1st. This will raise our annual spend from $1.1M to ~$1.32M.

Options on the table:

Negotiate a multi-year lock-in to limit increases (vendor open to this).
Evaluate switching to Asana Enterprise – initial analysis suggests $950K/year but requires user retraining and integration development ($200K one-time).
Would appreciate quick feedback so we can advise Procurement.

Cheers,
Tom Reynolds
