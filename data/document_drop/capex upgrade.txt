Subject: CapEx Approval Needed – HPC Cluster Upgrade
19th June 2024
Body: Hello,

We’re requesting CapEx approval of $3.5M for an urgent upgrade to our High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster supporting the Quantitative Analytics team. Current infrastructure is at 90% utilization, causing job queuing delays that are impacting trading analytics timelines.

ROI projections show a 4-month payback through increased throughput and faster model runs, potentially improving P&L outcomes by ~$1.2M annually.

Please review attached proposal and confirm if this can be fast-tracked for the next budget committee review.

Thanks,
Elena Cho
Head of Technology Operations
