Subject: AWS vs Azure Cost Comparison for FY25 Infrastructure Strategy
date: 1st, March 2025
Body: Hi team,

After the initial cost analysis, it appears that sticking with AWS for our core infrastructure will lead to a 12% increase in OpEx over the next 18 months due to higher data egress fees and premium support charges. Azure has proposed a 3-year Enterprise Agreement with a 15% discount on compute and storage, which could save us approximately $1.4M annually.

However, migrating existing workloads will incur a one-time cost of $850K, including re-architecting legacy systems and staff training.

Finance has asked us to finalize our recommendation by the end of Q1. We need to weigh short-term expenses vs long-term savings. Let's discuss during Thursdayâ€™s IT steering meeting.

Best,
Jessica Liu
